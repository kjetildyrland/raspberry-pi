This folder contains Flipper-format RF recordings from the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2022-23 season playoff game 1. There were for the RF-based bracelets, not IR.

All functional recordings were from 915Mhz; recordings at other frequencies were not functional. Note that bracelets in countries other than the USA may operate on different frequencies.

Most files were retransmitted with no effect. However, the following ones did work:

RAW_20230415-175742: Red/yellow probabalistic fades
RAW_20230415-180415 - Red/white/blue probabilistic fades
RAW_20230415-192857 - Yellow probabalistic fades
RAW_20230415-193302 - Yellow probabalistic quick fades at beginning, later other quick probabalistic fades. |||||||||| GONE THROUGH


Some of those raw files had a very long "silence" at the beginning, and I was impatient about waiting so long for them to transmit. I thus made some files where I manually removed leading long silence. I named these files with "amod_
" in front. Many of these also had effects:

amod_RAW_20230415-175400 - long pause, then yellow probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-180002 - white prob blinks
amod_RAW_20230415-180029 - yellow probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-180109 - yellow probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-180246 - yellow probabalistic fades, long pause, then faster yellow probabalistic fades, then long pause, then some red/yellow probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-180403 - white prob blink, then long pause, then red/white/blue probabilistic fades  |||||||||| GONE THROUGH
amod_RAW_20230415-180425 - red/white/blue quick probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-180525 - nothing
amod_RAW_20230415-180708 - white probabalistic blinks
amod_RAW_20230415-180913 - red/yellow quick probabalistic fades, then long pause, then white probabalistic blinks |||||||||| GONE THROUGH
amod_RAW_20230415-181258 - red/white/yellow probabalistic fades, then long pause, then white quick probabalistic blinks, then pause, then red/white/yellow probabalistic fades, then quick yellow probabalistic fades (and a couple whites)
amod_RAW_20230415-185256 - pause, then fast yellow probabalistic fades
amod_RAW_20230415-185326 - yellow probabalistic fades
